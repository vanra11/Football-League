Football if Super League happened


```python
Team and Player Management: 10 teams, each can have up to 15 players, are created in such a way that each player is assigned a position and earns points based on their performance.
Match Simulation: Simulates matches between teams with randomized outcomes and player performances.
Scoring System: Teams earn points for match outcomes (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss) and additional points based on individual player performances.
```

-Performance Metrics: Tracks and calculates various performance metrics, including total goals scored, goals conceded, and additional scores based on predefined factors.
Season Simulation: Ensures that each team plays exactly 12 matches throughout the season, even if it means facing some teams multiple times.

``` python
I have developed a comprehensive Fantasy Football simulation tool that calculates player scores, tracks team performance, and ranks teams based on normalized metrics, enhancing user engagement and strategic planning.

I even conducted an in-depth analysis of player statistics and team dynamics to inform strategic decisions in Fantasy Football leagues, resulting in improved team performance and competitive edge.
