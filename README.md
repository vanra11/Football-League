# Football-League

'''python
**Features**
Team and Player Management: 10 teams, each can have up to 15 players, are created in such a way that each player is assigned a position and earns points based on their performance.
Match Simulation: Simulates matches between teams with randomized outcomes and player performances.
Scoring System: Teams earn points for match outcomes (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 points for a loss) and additional points based on individual player performances.
'''

-Performance Metrics: Tracks and calculates various performance metrics, including total goals scored, goals conceded, and additional scores based on predefined factors.
Season Simulation: Ensures that each team plays exactly 12 matches throughout the season, even if it means facing some teams multiple times.
